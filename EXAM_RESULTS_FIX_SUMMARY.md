## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Missing Feature: Answer Submission During Exam

**Current Issue**: The exam page (`app/exam/[id]/page.tsx`) displays questions but **does NOT save student answers** when they select options or type responses.

**Impact**: 
- Students can take the exam but their answers are not recorded
- The review page will show all questions as "Not Answered"
- The submit API cannot calculate correct/incorrect answers

**What Needs to be Done**:

The exam page needs to be updated to:
1. Track answer selections/inputs in state
2. Save answers to `student_answers` table as student progresses
3. Use `upsert` operations to save answers in real-time or on question navigation

**Example Implementation Needed**:

```typescript
// Add state for answers
const [answers, setAnswers] = useState<Map<number, any>>(new Map());

// Handle MCQ selection
const handleMCQAnswer = async (questionId: number, selectedOption: string) => {
  const answer = {
    session_id: sessionId,
    question_id: questionId,
    selected_options: [selectedOption],
    answered_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
  
  await supabase
    .from('student_answers')
    .upsert(answer, { onConflict: 'session_id,question_id' });
    
  setAnswers(prev => new Map(prev).set(questionId, answer));
};

// Handle text answer
const handleTextAnswer = async (questionId: number, text: string) => {
  const answer = {
    session_id: sessionId,
    question_id: questionId,
    text_answer: text,
    answered_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  };
  
  await supabase
    .from('student_answers')
    .upsert(answer, { onConflict: 'session_id,question_id' });
    
  setAnswers(prev => new Map(prev).set(questionId, answer));
};
```

Then update the JSX to use these handlers:

```tsx
<input
  type="radio"
  name={`question-${question.id}`}
  onChange={() => handleMCQAnswer(question.id, option.text)}
  className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-500"
/>

<textarea
  onChange={(e) => handleTextAnswer(question.id, e.target.value)}
  onBlur={(e) => handleTextAnswer(question.id, e.target.value)}
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Database Schema Requirements

Ensure these tables exist with proper structure:

### `student_answers`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- session_id (uuid, foreign key)
- question_id (text or integer)
- selected_options (text[])
- text_answer (text)
- is_correct (boolean)
- marks_obtained (numeric)
- time_spent_seconds (integer)
- answered_at (timestamp)
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

UNIQUE(session_id, question_id) -- For upsert
```

### `exam_results`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- session_id (uuid, unique, foreign key)
- student_id (uuid, foreign key)
- exam_id (uuid, foreign key)
- total_questions (integer)
- attempted_questions (integer)
- correct_answers (integer)
- wrong_answers (integer)
- total_marks (numeric)
- marks_obtained (numeric)
- percentage (numeric)
- grade (text)
- pass_status (boolean)
- cheat_score (numeric)
- focus_score (numeric)
- proctoring_status (text)
- submitted_at (timestamp)
```

### `exam_review_history`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- session_id (uuid, foreign key)
- student_id (uuid, foreign key)
- question_id (text, nullable)
- requested_ai_explanation (boolean)
- ai_explanation_text (text)
- ai_explanation_tokens (integer)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Student can see questions during exam
- [ ] Student answers are saved to database as they answer
- [ ] Submit button calculates correct results
- [ ] Results page shows academic score + focus score
- [ ] Results page has working "Review Answers" button
- [ ] Review page shows all questions with student answers
- [ ] Review page shows correct answers highlighted
- [ ] "Get AI Review" button generates comprehensive review

## Environment Variables Required

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4
```

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Implement answer tracking in exam page
2. **Priority 2**: Test the complete flow end-to-end
3. **Priority 3**: Add database migrations if tables don't exist
4. **Priority 4**: Add error handling and loading states
5. **Priority 5**: Add answer auto-save functionality (every 30 seconds)

## Files Modified

1. `app/exam/[id]/results/page.tsx` - Enhanced results display
2. `app/exam/review/[sessionId]/page.tsx` - Added AI review feature
3. `app/api/exam/submit/route.ts` - Enhanced result calculation
4. `app/api/exam/ai-review/route.ts` - New comprehensive AI review endpoint

## Files That Need Modification

1. `app/exam/[id]/page.tsx` - **CRITICAL**: Add answer tracking and submission
